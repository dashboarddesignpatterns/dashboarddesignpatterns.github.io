# COMPONENT DESIGN PATTERNS
The COMPONENTSof a dashboard are the “ingredients” the dash-
board is made of; they are the crucial elements relating to the data
and its presentation. We identified four groups of design patterns:
data information, meta information, the visual encoding of the
data, and the high level interactions supported by the dashboard.
We disregard any visual components that purely serve as decoration
or embellishment, e.g., illustrative pictures, dividers, borders, etc.
