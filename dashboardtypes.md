# Dashboard Templates

We see a distinction between **curated dashboards** (static dash-
board , magazine dashboard , infographic dashboard ) that
are highly selective of data and visual representation towards a spe-
cific goal, and **data collection dashboards** (analytic dashboard , repository
dashboard ), which aim to transmit large volumes of informa-
tion so that viewers can seek the information most relevant to them.
Curated dashboards can be described as author-driven storytelling,
while collection dashboards can be described as reader-driven story-
telling in the terminology of Segel and Heer.

## Curated dashboards

Curated dashboards will typically fit on a single screen with a
flat or overflow layout, and offer limited ability to change
the data or its visual encodings (i.e., limited parameterization ).
Creating such dashboards requires a greater extent of curation, de-
sign, and selection, i.e., representing the right information using the
right visual encodings. These dashboards will have well-defined
use cases, and the designer’s role is to ‘translate’ the data for that
purpose [33].


### Static Dashboard:
By static dashboard, we refer to the traditional notion
of a dashboard as a static (no-interaction) and flat structure dis-
play of information; for example, Fig. 4–left (#19) shows a classic
dashboard that does not require interaction. We did not find many
examples of classic static dashboards (only 21%), which we attribute
to the fact that contemporary dashboards are digital and it is easy
to support interaction and drill-down tasks through more complex
structures. Another reason might be that the range of display sizes
on desktop computers, tablets, and mobiles encourages adaptive
solutions (e.g., use of overflow or paginated structure)

### Magazine Dashboards:
Many dashboards relating to Covid-19, climate change,
politics, etc were created by news agencies and similar media outlets.
These dashboards are found as integral part of journalistic articles
and resemble visualizations of the magazine genre [48]. The text
goes beyond basic meta information to provide additional commen-
tary and storytelling about the data. These dashboards are often
broken into several pages and have an overflow structure with linear
layout, with visualizations positioned at appropriate points in the
text to tell a story about what the data shows


## Data collection Dashboards

Data collections are dashboards that provide access to lots of data,
represented in different ways for different tasks (e.g., for analytical
use or for sharing open data). Whilst a degree of curation is required
(i.e., the designer has made deliberate decisions about how to show
the data), there is less need to reduce the amount of visible content.
These dashboards typically use pagination and/or overflow ,
as the goal is not to make the most economic use of screen space
but to maximize the amount of information available to users, such
that they can find what they are most interested in. The use cases for
these dashboards are more open-ended and they are often aimed at a more broad audience. Data collections invite interaction and may
even require it to meet the user’s information needs.

### Analytic dashboards (73%):
This template is what Few would call a Faceted Analytic Dis-
play [23]. We see strong parallels to the concept of Multiple Coor-
dinates View [42]. This template generally uses complete visual-
izations (rather than just signature charts and trend arrows). Many
of these views are fully interactive, providing for pan+zoom, fo-
cus+context, tooltips, brushing+linking and other exploration and
navigation strategies. These dashboards can also provide parameter-
ization, and use tabs or linking to switch between multiple pages of
the dashboard. Importantly, these dashboards generally do not use overflow pagination, since scrolling complicates comparing visual-
izations.
