Dashboards offer a curated lens through which people can view large
and complex data sets at a glance [22, 33]. They combine visual
representations and other graphical embellishments to provide layers
of abstraction and simplification for numerous related data points,
so that dashboard viewers get an overview of the most important or
relevant information, in a time efficient way. Their ability to provide
insight at a glance has led to dashboards being widely used across
many application domains, such as business [22, 38], nursing and
hospitals [8, 19, 32, 37, 54, 54], public health [35], learning analytics
[13], urban analytics [36], personal analytics, energy [24] and more,
summarized elsewhere [22, 41, 44, 55]. These examples, designed
mainly for an audience with domain expertise, have since been
complemented by dashboards for public health or political elections,
designed for a more general audience and disseminated through news
media [56] or dedicated dashboard and tracker websites [5, 16, 49]
