# Dashboard Design Guidelines

## High-level Design Guidelines

1. Balance data + space (cost) while increasing information
1. Avoid redundancy of information
1. Show information, rather than data
				
## Specific Design Guidelines

1. Where space allows, **provide redundant and complementary views**
(visual encodings) and levels of abstraction (data information) for
your data:
  * e.g., show selected numbers alongside trend-arrows
and signature charts
  * e.g., more abstract encodings can occupy more screen space
to emphasize importance/relevance/etc
  * e.g., use single values , derived values and thresh-
olds to show key data points at a glance;

1. For **transparency**, provide meta information:
  * e.g., state the data source , provide disclaimers
about how data were processed;
  * e.g., use tooltips or pagination if space is con-
strained;

1. **Avoid overflow structure in analytic dashboards** to facilitate
comparison;
   * e.g., use flat or paginated dashboards that fit encod-
ings on screen;

1. **Minimize repetitive data using abstraction** (to emphasize key data)
and parameterization (to support personalization );

1. **Consider the dashboard templates** best suited to the dashboard
audience and their informational needs, and use their characteristic
design patterns as a checklist for design. 

1. Try to ensure a **consistent color scheme** across the entire dash-
board, either by reusing colors for the same data and value, or by
creating a dedicated and clearly distinguishable scheme for each
visualization.

1. **Chose a layout that expresses relations between widgets**; following
a given schema , grouping by type or task , structured in a
table , or stratified to show important information on top


	○ T: Structure
			§ A good structure is informed by (i) data (facets, information), and tasks (overview, comparison).
			§ That structure needs to reflect structure in data and task
		○ Interaction 
			§ Interaction can be a powerful means to personalize, explore, navigate, and focus. 
			§ Minimize interaction: If you can solve something with minimal or no interaction, go for it.
		○ Dashboard templates
			§ Templates provide examples of dashboards in specific scenarios
			§ Use curated dashboards (static dashboard, magazine dashboards, infographic dashbaord) where to goal is to inform your audience without much intervention / interaction from their side.
