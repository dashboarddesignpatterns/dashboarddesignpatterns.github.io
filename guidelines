# Dashboard Design Guidelines

## High-level Design Guidelines


## Specific Design Guidelines

Where space allows, provide redundant and complementary views
(visual encodings) and levels of abstraction (data information) for
your data:
*  e.g., show selected numbers alongside trend-arrows
and signature charts ;
*  e.g., more abstract encodings can occupy more screen space
to emphasize importance/relevance/etc;
*  e.g., use single values , derived values and thresh-
olds to show key data points at a glance;

For transparency, provide meta information:
* e.g., state the data source , provide disclaimers
about how data were processed;
*  e.g., use tooltips or pagination if space is con-
strained;

Avoid overflow structure in analytic dashboards to facilitate
comparison;
* e.g., use flat or paginated dashboards that fit encod-
ings on screen;

Minimize repetitive data using abstraction (to emphasize key data)
and parameterization (to support personalization );

Consider the dashboard templates best suited to the dashboard
audience and their informational needs, and use their characteristic
design patterns as a checklist for design (as in Sect. 6);

Try to ensure a consistent color scheme across the entire dash-
board, either by reusing colors for the same data and value, or by
creating a dedicated and clearly distinguishable scheme for each
visualization.

Chose a layout that expresses relations between widgets; following
a given schema , grouping by type or task , structured in a
table , or stratified to show important information on top
