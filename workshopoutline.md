# Workshop outline


## Activity 1: Dashboard genres:
* Show examples of dashboards and their genres
* Let people discuss what they think about the dashboard they see. Let them discuss what they like / dislike about these dashboards. What do they think about the possible audience?

## Introduce general dahsbaord guidelines: 
* Highlight some high-level guidelines (slide 22)
* Discuss trade-offs and factors involved in dashboard design (slide 24

## Introduce design thinking
* Explain double diamond (Slide 26)

## Activity 2: What Am I Designing For? 
* Have participants think about the following questions: 
  * Who is my audience? What does the audience know about the data?
  * What are the tasks they perform / decisions they make? What do they know about these tasks? During which steps of their workflows and during which situations do they need access to the dashboard? 
  * What is the context & devices they engage with the dashboard? Is it a mobile, a 2nd screen, a wall-sized display, etc.? What else do they do when they consult the dashboard? How frequently do they consult the dashboard?  
  * What other information do they need to fulfil their tasks / make these decisions?
* Discuss these things in groups of 2-3 (depending on time).

## Introduce design tradeoffs (slides 33-35):
* Explain that some of these factors might be in your control, others not. In any case, you need to make decisions to optimize the information shown
  * If you want to show more information than fits your screen, you can 
    * Increase the number of pages of your dashboard, or
    * Increase abstraction of information, e.g., less detailed visualization, or remove data, or aggregate data, or
Add interaction to, e.g., navigate between pages, obtain details on demand
  * more information on this [design tradeoff example](tradeoffs) 

## Introduce design patterns: 
* Introduce the idea of design patterns, if required (slide 37)
* Overview types of patterns for dashboard. Explain they are
  * Possible solutions to solve design tradeoffs
  * Ideas to discuss solutions
  * May not be complete, but aims to get ideas started
  * May patterns can be combined, i.e., using one patterns does not preclude using another one.
## Activity 3: Data Information Patterns (green patterns) (~10min)
* Briefly introduce the pattern in this type, i.e., say something high-level about them. 
* Give everyone time to think through the patterns and which ones might be appropriate for their dashboard. 
* Let them discuss their choices in groups. 
## Repeat activity 3
In the following, I was running that same activity for each of the patterns in the order I list below. You may want to change the order (or remove some of them) depending on your time budget and the scope of the dashboards to create. Ideally, you want to stretch the whole workshop over more sessions, with a few pattern categories in each session (1-2) to give people time to think and design a little bit at home...
1. Structure patterns (pink)
1. Visual representation (red)
1. Layouts (gray)
1. Screenspace (purple)
1. Interaction (yellow)
