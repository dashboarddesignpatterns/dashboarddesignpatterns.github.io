# Design Tradeoffs

![](docs/assets/figures/tradeoffs2.png)


Every design process and design problem is unique in that several
parameters must be considered: users, tasks, contexts, devices, etc.
Design tradeoffs are inevitable when no solution is optimal, i.e.,
when the specific parameters of a design problem have contradic-
tory knowledge (e.g., guidelines, heuristics, solutions). Dashboard
designers can use this knowledge to inform their approach, but other
activities (deliberate or otherwise) will be necessary: e.g., reasoning
and logic, experimentation and prototyping, user-centered design
and evaluation. Decisions may likely influence or conflict with other 
decisions, causing further design tradeoffs to be necessary, requiring
constant iteration towards good design. This discourse will evolve with the set of design patterns and future empirical studies.
