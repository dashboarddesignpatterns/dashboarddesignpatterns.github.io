# Dashboard Desgign Workshop
This workshop aims to help you with the design of dashboards using a set of [dashboard design patterns](patterns.html). The workshop will be held online and has synchronous and asynchronous parts. As part of our research, we aim to understand design principles for dashboard design and how our design patterns can support this design process through: ideation, reflection, and analysis.  

If you have any specific questions, please get in touch with [Benjamin Bach](mailto:bbach@inf.ed.ac.uk) 

## Goals

This workshop is part of our research on dashboard design and wants to investigate creative and reflective practices around dashboard design.  

What this workshop will help you with:
* design your own dashboard(s) in the form of visual mockups and sketches.
* Understand design decisions and tradeoffs
* Make deliberate design decisions and reflect on these choices.
* Use state-of-the-art tools for mockups and design sketches
* Discuss your designs with peers and learn from others. 

What this workshop will not support: 
* An introduction to Tableau, Power BI, or similar tools.
* A workshop on programming visualizations, e.g., through D3. 
* An opportunity to obtain a certificate in dashboard design.

## Preriquisites

The workshop does not require any specific skills but instead some sort of project: 
* Some data/topic that you want to design a dashboard for. This can be data you have full access to, or data you are planning to collect. It can include any data you are interested in, e.g., public data, data from your research, personal data, etc.
* Some context for the dashboard, including: *whom is this dashboard for? What does the dashboard support people in? Where do people see (and potentially interact) with the dashboard?*
* depending on the size of the project, a dedicated amount of time during the weeks to work on your designs to obtain feedback and discuss with others. 


## Schedule and outline
